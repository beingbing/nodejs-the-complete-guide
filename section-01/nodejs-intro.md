# javascript
- javascript is a programming language which we typically use in a browser to manipulate DOM (page loaded in browser).
As JS is a language which runs in a browser that allows us to interact with the page after it was loaded, hence, play
a crucial part in building interactive user interfaces in the browser. However, JS is not just limited to browser.

# node.js
- it is a javascript runtime.
- node.js is a different version of JS. It is basically built on JS and adds new features to it along with not capable
of doing things which JS is capable of doing inside browser, like manipulating DOM, because there is no DOM outside
browser. 
- So, it is JS but in a different environment outside browser. It can run on a normal machine, hence, can also run a
server.
- So, node.js is a way of running JS outside of browser on any machine and therefore on servers as well.
- node.js uses google V8 JS engine
- node.js give you a new feature of accessing local FS as you are no longer inside browser.

# browser
- google uses V8 JS engine to convert JS code into machine language code inside browser
- V8 engine is written in C++
- you can not access your local FS inside browser due to security reasons.
